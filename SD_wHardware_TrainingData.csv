INC1059532,Relocating two workstations from Buhr 3205 to North Quad 1270,"Thanks Paul

I updated the inventory information to reflect that those two computers are now in North Quad.  Let us know if you need anything else.

Michael Emery
NIT Central 2","I write to let you know that two computers in Buhr 3205, currently assigned
to the Special Collections Library, are being loaned to me for one year, in
my capacity as PI of an NEH gran A team of student workers has been using
the equipment to support the digitization of radio program scripts and the
processing of audio files that have already been digitized. The NEH grant
ends on August 31, 2018.

To provide flexibility of workspace in North Quad, which is really tight,
I'm developing the notion of a ""pop up lab"" that utilizes industrial carts
on wheels as workstations.  I know it sounds crazy, but I want to see if I
can make it work. I will also be using some of this ""mobile computing""
equipment to support two graduate level courses that I am teaching next
year.

With that as background, I would like to relocate the equipment to North
Quad next week (the week after Memorial Day).  I do not need help with the
physical relocation, but I will need help with setup in North Quad and to
have the appropriate ""paperwork"" done so that you all know that equipment
that was once in Buhr will reside in North Quad for the next 12 months or
so.

The following are the serial numbers for the two machines in Buhr 3205 that
we will relocate to North Quad.

Which reports as being in:  ITS

hasn't checked in in over a year and is either listed in Service Link as ""missing"", ""in use"" or ""in stock""

If it's ""in use"" � well, if it is � it's not checking in to izzy!

If it's ""missing"" � that's up to you if you want to remove the izzy record,  I'd recommend it because if it hasn't checked in in a year, it probably went to Property Disposition (or was stolen/lost) and leaving it in izzy won't change that.

If it's ""in stock"" � you have two recommended options:   1)  Remove it from izzy or 2) find it and update it.  The stronger recommendation here is just to remove it from izzy as � if it's been a year � it will be faster to reload it than it would be to update all the apps on it *and* the operating system.  IF YOU UPDATE IT � be sure to log in after you update it and run Managed Software Center to check for updates one more time so that current logs get uploaded!  


If you know it no longer exists � please delete it from izzy?   And then update SL accordingly.

To: Cathleen Glowka <cdennie@umich.edu>


Too funny. You must have sent this as I was updating the MiWorkspace
Onboarding request with the following information:

Hardware requirements: Elana should receive a Housing Standard Laptop
package (HP 640 14"" (i7@3.6GHz/8G/500G HDD/DVD/5.1#), 45W pwr adapter, 90W
Dock, HP Keyboard/Mouse (B1T09AA#ABA)). Equipment should come from Housing
stock at the Depot/Novastar. It should be imaged with euc-build-hsg-bf.

Please note that Elana will be located in 1030 - STUDENT ACTIVITIES, at the
desk currently occupied by Joyce Vail. MIWS0018990 - HP HP ProDesk 600 G2
SFF with 2 24"" displays are deployed there. So when Elana starts on May 1
please deliver the laptop and power adapter only. The remainder of the
docking set up can be deployed to that location when Joyce retires at the
end of the month. The docking set up will use the displays currently
deployed and MIWS0018990 - HP HP ProDesk 600 G2 SFF with it's keyboard &
mouse can be returned to Housing stock here at Markley. This change should
happen on June 1.
##

Shouldn't be a problem to have Elana's laptop ready for her when she starts
and wait until June to deploy the rest of the docking set up and remove
Joyce's computer at that point.

Thanks.  �dino

Hi, Dino,

In our chat yesterday, we agreed to order a laptop for our new employee to
replace Joyce's desktop, with a scheduled date of June 1st.  Would it be
possible to provide Elana a laptop sooner, like on May 2nd, and Joyce still
keep her desktop until June 1st, and simply swap out the desktop for the
docking station/keyboard that day?  What are your thoughts?  My thought is
that Elana could do some of her online training using her laptop and not be
dependent on Joyce's workstation.

Thanks!

After spending some time with the problem today, I determined it was a bad USB port on the dock that was causing the crashes. It may have been damaged in the move, or it may have existed previously and nothing was plugged in to that port on the dock. 

In either case, after replacing the dock with another of the same, I was able to log in and shut down several times without issue. I don't expect you to experience any problems going forward. Please let me know ASAP if this issue reoccurs and we'll take the appropriate steps to get it solved for you.

(839 Greene St.) on Tuesday, June 13.



She has already been set up with her email, etc., but I need a computer
workstation set up and ready to go by 6/13.



Two complicating issues:



1.       I will be away at a conference June 3-12 and unable to answer
questions during that time; I am the only one who will be able to answer
questions.

2.       This workstation may ultimately be shared with another employee. I
will know if that is the case until June 15.



At a minimum, Claire will need a PC with 2 monitors. She needs the standard
suite that includes Word and Excel. She will need Adobe Acrobat X Pro (she
needs to be able to edit/mark up pdfs).



These computers will be going into the workstation on the right in Office
marked 2524 at 839 Greene ST. (South Buhr�the yellow brick building part).



If it helps, the computer set-up that I had in that same space for temps
Rebekah McClure and Stephanie Walla are the same set-ups I will need for
this workstation, but keep in mind that this may end up being a shared
workstation so it needs to not be set up just for one person�s use.

I've been running into more and more issues related to running out of memory (8 GB) on the MacBook Pro I have. I'm rebooting at least once a day and it's been crashing a lot - even after a rebuild a few months ago. I've had it for close to 3.5 years.

It appears that the newer 15"" MacBook Pro machines come with more memory (16 GB) straight out of the box - so that seems like a good solution.

Alok asked me to reach out to you, and also said he'd support an early upgrade request. Is that something that you can assist with?

I am in the process of moving my office from 4214 to 4216-A, on the 4th
floor of Ed Studies (4218 suite).  Would someone be available tomorrow
morning to reconnect my printer and laptop into my new office?  I've
actually already carried my printer into my new space, but left all the
cords in 4214.  Also, I have a stand-up/sit-down monitor arm that will need
to be un-clamped from the edge of my desk, and moved and re-clamped to the
edge of my new desk.  (Would be easiest I think to leave the monitor intact
and just carry the whole works over...but will leave that up to whoever
does this).

I will be out of the office this afternoon, but will be back tomorrow
(Thursday) morning.  If you prefer to do some of this work this afternoon,
that is fine with me.....whatever works for you.  I would like to be set up
in my new space tomorrow if possible.

This mac:  https://izzy.dsc.umich.edu/systems/10385

Which reports as being in:  School of Education

Apparently did not get the forced-update of the latest Mac OS 10.10 security update and is active within the last 1-3 days.

NOTE ABOUT THIS ONE:   It looks like it has had the force-logout attempted many times in the last 2 days, but the updates have never installed -- you might ask the user to manually install the updates as we can't tell why the force update is not actually starting on this one.


Please check this one out  (or ask the user run Managed Software Center manually) to get it updated.  When updated, it should be running 10.10.5 14F2315    You do not have to upgrade to 10.12 to resolve this issue (but doing so will also resolve it�)

So I've been told that these particular Mac Mini's were purchased by NCID when they were still with MiWorkspace. However, because they were purchased by the department they still belonged to the department after they left MWS, and even though they have a MiWorkspace tag on them they are property of the department. Theo Tangalakis (tmtangal) told me that he had previously talked about those specific machines with NCID and that they wanted to dispo them because they were old. Sorry for the confusion, if you have any more questions feel free to reach out to me.

INC1054987,System names 4HELP-VTS1 may need updates to address MS17-010 (WannaCry),"Hi Kevin,

I am losing this ticket.  I hope you have a nice day.

Greg","Hi - I'm initially assigning this to NIT North 1 since this system appears to be on a subnet for which neighborhood.it.north.1@umich.edu is the ""network admin"" contact.

There's a system named ""4HELP-VTS1"" that is being detected by Nessus as still needing the MS17-010 updates from Microsoft. This means that it could be compromised by a remote attacker using the ""EternalBlue"" exploit that was used by the recent WannaCry ransomware outbreak. During our scan on Thursday, the system was using IP address 141.213.150.102. The VLAN description is ""ITS Arbor Lakes IS staff network"". Netdisco shows the MAC address as 00:15:5d:85:01:03 (Microsoft) and it appears to be connected to a switch on the 2nd floor of AL 1.

Someone should locate the device and identify who is able to get Windows updates applied so that the system will no longer be vulnerable to exploitation of the MS17-010 vulnerabilities.

Please let me know if there are any questions.

ITS N. Campus","Hello,

I have been issued an HP ProBook 640 laptop with MI-Workspace number
M-5CG5242SFM (the tag on the device is MWIS0016371).  This morning I
noticed some dead pixels along the right side of my laptop's screen.  I'm
not sure what, if anything, is typically done in these cases.  It's strange
to see though, because I keep it in a laptop bag at all times when not in
use and typically use it docked in a docking station.  To the best of my
knowledge I've never dropped it, either in the bag or outside of it.  I
have attached a screen clip, with the dead pixels highlighted for contrast.

INC1059436,Slow computer,"Hi Sally,

The re-imaging does seem to have helped. The startup/login time is under 5 minutes now, less than half of what it was yesterday. I told staff working at the desk that it will never be really fast because it has only 4GB of memory while MiWorkspace recommends 8GB. It is also four years old and out of warranty, so I suspect it will get replaced sometime later this year. I reinstalled printers and verified that Chrome opens to the preset tabs like before. Data was also transferred for the major accounts.

Have a good holiday weekend,

If it's ""in use"" � well, if it is � it's not checking in to izzy!

If it's ""missing"" � that's up to you if you want to remove the izzy record,  I'd recommend it because if it hasn't checked in in a year, it probably went to Property Disposition (or was stolen/lost) and leaving it in izzy won't change that.

If it's ""in stock"" � you have two recommended options:   1)  Remove it from izzy or 2) find it and update it.  The stronger recommendation here is just to remove it from izzy as � if it's been a year � it will be faster to reload it than it would be to update all the apps on it *and* the operating system.  IF YOU UPDATE IT � be sure to log in after you update it and run Managed Software Center to check for updates one more time so that current logs get uploaded!  


If you know it no longer exists � please delete it from izzy?   And then update SL accordingly.

removed from izzy.

","
This mac:  https://izzy.dsc.umich.edu/systems/14339

Which reports as being in:  Michigan Creative

hasn't checked in in over a year and is either listed in Service Link as ""missing"", ""in use"" or ""in stock""

If it's ""in use"" � well, if it is � it's not checking in to izzy!

If it's ""missing"" � that's up to you if you want to remove the izzy record,  I'd recommend it because if it hasn't checked in in a year, it probably went to Property Disposition (or was stolen/lost) and leaving it in izzy won't change that.

If it's ""in stock"" � you have two recommended options:   1)  Remove it from izzy or 2) find it and update it.  The stronger recommendation here is just to remove it from izzy as � if it's been a year � it will be faster to reload it than it would be to update all the apps on it *and* the operating system.  IF YOU UPDATE IT � be sure to log in after you update it and run Managed Software Center to check for updates one more time so that current logs get uploaded!  


If you know it no longer exists � please delete it from izzy?   And then update SL accordingly.

If you have questions, do not hesitate to ask!

biggest issue being that my computer is running very very slow. I often
have to wait several seconds for tabs to open, or for things to refresh. My
screen will go dark for many minutes upon un-docking and often upon
re-docking my computer will have to be re-started. The work I do requires

slowdown, but is unavoidable.

INC1056447,No internet connection,"Hi Pamela,

It was a pleasure meeting you and I'm glad we were able to get the laptop working again. With regard to the ""Chat with 4-Help"" option on your Mac, I talked to our Mac team about that and they have set an update to be applied to your computer to enable that option.  I would say if the ""Chat with 4-Help"" option is not on your Mac by tomorrow morning, let us know and we can investigate further. The option on your Mac should also point you to the correct form that will allow you to chat directly with 4-Help. The next time you have an issue, I would encourage you to give it a shot as many of our users have found they prefer it over calling 4-help. 

If you have any questions or need further assistance let us know and have a great day!

Thanks for reaching out!

I was able to remote into most of the player machines except for one that is off line (M-G6RY517003HW). The NUCs that are running the School of Information signs should still be supported till FY19 by us. As for the NQ signage players, they are all the same version of 4.1 of the MacMinis. Unfortunately the support for them from us recently ended.

If you are interested in replacing the player machines, our recommendation would be the HP 260 G2 series. Please visit the link below for product details:

http://computershowcase.umich.edu/item.php?cat=5&item=152602&id=4326

We would be gladly process your order for you. We would just need a short code, authorized signer and the quantities from you. We would install our signage build on to the machines and drop it off to you when ready. You would need to install the players and update Content Manager to point to the new machines. I hope this answered your question.

Thanks again,
Ben Wang

1) Her computer not always charging when the charger was plugged in no matter the charger (display or separate power adapter).
2) Her computer slowing down and showing the spinning wheel when she selects the Save As option.  She said that it eventually stops and she can save.
3) She wanted to know the age of her machine and when she would be up for an upgrade."

-Brett","Hi Depot/Tech Repair,

We have a machine we think may have a fried motherboard. We believe it stems from the power outage a couple weeks ago. The power button lights up when you hold down the startup button on the machine, but goes away if you release and does nothing. We attempted to replace the power supply with one we had here, but it led to the same outcome. 

It's a very new machine, still under warranty.

INC1044241,Please find this izzy mac that has not checked in in more than a year,This device is no longer needed so I removed it from izzy.,"
This mac:  https://izzy.dsc.umich.edu/systems/8349

Which reports as being in:  Non-MiWorkspace - School of Natural Resources & the Environment

hasn't checked in in over a year and is either listed in Service Link as ""missing"", ""in use"" or ""in stock""

If it's ""in use"" � well, if it is � it's not checking in to izzy!

If it's ""missing"" � that's up to you if you want to remove the izzy record,  I'd recommend it because if it hasn't checked in in a year, it probably went to Property Disposition (or was stolen/lost) and leaving it in izzy won't change that.

If it's ""in stock"" � you have two recommended options:   1)  Remove it from izzy or 2) find it and update it.  The stronger recommendation here is just to remove it from izzy as � if it's been a year � it will be faster to reload it than it would be to update all the apps on it *and* the operating system.  IF YOU UPDATE IT � be sure to log in after you update it and run Managed Software Center to check for updates one more time so that current logs get uploaded!  


HOWEVER -- because this is a ""non-MiWorkspace"" mac -- if there's a need to actually use this computer -- we recommend you remove it from izzy and reload it in the MWS SNRE organization.


If you know it no longer exists � please delete it from izzy?   And then update SL accordingly.

If you have questions, do not hesitate to ask!

We have a ProDesk which receives the error message ""SMART Hard Drive detects imminent failure"" Failing Attribute: #05 on boot. It's able to still boot after this, but from what I've read this is typically a pretty accurate error/prediction that shouldn't be ignored, even if it is somehow made to go away.

Your PC should be all set now and the printer is now on the network so you and your office mate can both use it at any time. You computer was already connected to the printer so it should print just fine on the network now. If you do run into any issues with it you may need to reinstall the printer on the Miworkspace printer Installer.

Directions for printer installer:
Click the colorful monitor icon in the corner of your display and choose Miworkspace Print Installer.
You can just type in your office number and the printer will come up.
Select that printer and hit the ""generate installer"" blue box
This will download the installer and just hit run when its ready.
Once this completes the printer will be ready to use.

Prof. Martin Katz let me know that his office iMac won't start up all the
way after installed updates via Managed Software Center.   He starts it up

INC1044251,Please find this izzy mac that has not checked in in more than a year,This computer has been re-imaged and MiWorkspaced.,"
This mac:  https://izzy.dsc.umich.edu/systems/4140

Which reports as being in:  Non-MiWorkspace - School of Natural Resources & the Environment

hasn't checked in in over a year and is either listed in Service Link as ""missing"", ""in use"" or ""in stock""

If it's ""in use"" � well, if it is � it's not checking in to izzy!

If it's ""missing"" � that's up to you if you want to remove the izzy record,  I'd recommend it because if it hasn't checked in in a year, it probably went to Property Disposition (or was stolen/lost) and leaving it in izzy won't change that.

If it's ""in stock"" � you have two recommended options:   1)  Remove it from izzy or 2) find it and update it.  The stronger recommendation here is just to remove it from izzy as � if it's been a year � it will be faster to reload it than it would be to update all the apps on it *and* the operating system.  IF YOU UPDATE IT � be sure to log in after you update it and run Managed Software Center to check for updates one more time so that current logs get uploaded!  


HOWEVER -- because this is a ""non-MiWorkspace"" mac -- if there's a need to actually use this computer -- we recommend you remove it from izzy and reload it in the MWS SNRE organization.


If you know it no longer exists � please delete it from izzy?   And then update SL accordingly.

If you have questions, do not hesitate to ask!

-Brett","Hello,

We will be moving some work areas around in lower Buhr. There is a back
area (formerly had one employee, Sam Killian, in the space) that we would
like to convert into a work space for our student workers. We are working
with facilities to move furniture around, but we are hoping to have 3-4
computers in that one area. Brett looked at the jack and thinks this is
probably possible, but what are our next steps? Should you come out and
test the jacks or hook up the computers we have, or do you want to wait for
facilities (I sort of want to make sure we know the jack positions and
where we can put computers before I have them place the desks......but
maybe we can put them anywhere and we simply would need longer
cords....please let me know your thoughts).

Let me know if you have any questions, need more information.

Thanks so much,
Renee

If you have administrative rights on your machine, you're welcome to install those updates at your purview.

In short, feel free to install those updates, and steps are being taken by system administration to take care of the audio driver issue.  If you have any further issues regarding this request please let us know so we can offer further assistance.

I am sorry for bothering you, but I just found that my meeting with the
candidate was postponed to Friday 1:45 to 2:15pm. I already confirmed with
Tom that I can use my office until this Friday for the meeting with the
candidate. So, I am wondering if IT staff can move my computer on Friday
after 2:15pm. I copied this email to IT, but I am not sure the contact
information is correct. Thank you very much for helping me out with moving
to the Forest Hall.

INC1049851,Computer sleep/shutdown issue + no color options to printer,"Provided a new power strip and turned off ""hybrid sleep"". Was able to look through the machine's event logs and find a spot where an unwanted shutdown occurred. It ""shutdown procedure"" was initiated at 1:10 PM when a previous user got off of the machine, and then actually shut down when Norm came and tried to use the machine at 5:15. Windows Engineering did not recognize the shutdown codes provided by the log, so it's difficult to discern exactly what may have caused that particular unwanted shutdown, and it's difficult to test any sort of solution because we have no way of replicating the issue. I asked Norm to keep track of the date/time if it occurs again so we can attempt to isolate what may be the cause. 

-Brett","Norm Harris
Conversation Lab - Buhr
Norm has two issues:
1) His computer has been going into sleep mode and then, when we try to wake it, it goes into the shutdown sequence.  Local IT staff had been there before and suggested that the power strip might be the cause and should be swapped.

2) Library facilities made a change to 
m-buhr-3212-colormulti-1
to print default as black and white.  No matter what Norm or his colleague do to choose color (on his computer or at the konica control panel at the device) all printing is black and white -- they are windows users.  The Mac users in this area can print color just fine.

Given these two issues, we thought it would be worthwhile for a tech to come out to see if they can put both issues to bed.  Norm is best available in later morning and afternoon to arrange a visit.  Phone 763-2446 if needed.  Thanks!"

I am not sure if this may requireme some element of cleaning /
de-fragmenting or if it is a hardware issue.

It's a HP Compaq Pro 6300, I5, Windows 7.
