Hi Judith & Marjory,

Audio is working in the room.  We've checked all the table inputs (both HDMI & VGA), and all produce audio.  We believe this was the case when we first entered the room.  There were issues with the PC not producing audio output; this is perhaps what people were reporting?  We suspect it may have had to do with recent power events, but really can't say for sure.  We did restart it several times -- in each case it did seem to take an inordinately long time to boot, indicating the possibility of other issues, but eventually, it did start producing audio again.  The video conferencing audio does work, but the volume level is not indicated on the display, as indicated in the photos; we'll get that addressed.  We'll also address the issue requiring Macs to be plugged into only the VGA ports.

Thank you for getting in touch with us, and please don't hesitate if there are any issues in the future.

Friday, April 21, for a meeting that starts at 1p. There's a possibility
someone will show a PowerPoint and they may want to access the internet.
Would someone be able to meet me there between 1-1:15p? Do you know if
there is a laptop in the room, or should we bring our own?

This meeting is the faculty advisory committee for three vice presidents,
so I'm a little nervous about having to deal with any AV that may be

Friday, but I wanted to give you notice in case we do need help.

It appears, someone has removed the cable.

While we are currently using this room routinely once a month, it would be most beneficial if we could project to both screens.

Could someone please assist me in making this happen, and telling me what cable/connection we need to do that?

Thank you,

This is DJ from the IT Office. The issues of Pink discoloration is due to the projector's hardware scalier that is connected to the A/V system in the classroom. By selecting the ""Windows+P"" keys to toggle the computer to go into mirror/extend mode this forced the scalier to re-calibrate itself and the picture is now normal. I know I showed you this process after the fix was done, but wanted to let you know in writing so you know for future reference. The instructions are also posted on the classroom desk podium for users to see if like problems occur.

Event organizer Prof. Silvia Lindtner has been informed that speakers will need to bring their own laptops and that speakers w/ Mac laptops should bring a dongle to connect to the VGA or HDMI projector input.

Not a problem at all.

For external speakers with no unique names to use we typically get the computer logged on with the generic ""phar-miworkspacetemp"" account, I am sure they should be fine with this. Once the generic account is logged in we set it to a 4 hour sleep delay. I will make sure Ben is there to get them logged in, setup that delay time (so the machine will not time out on them during their session), and to make sure the projector is working correctly before the class starts at 1pm.

Let me know if that sounds good for your request.

Hi Katie,

I've reserved the School of Nursing Auditorium for you on 3/16/17 from 3:30pm-5:00pm. I reached out to IT regarding any special direction for this room, and they let me know that there is a computer and a touch panel in the auditorium for turning everything on. They mentioned that if you could let me know within a few days of your event if you will be needing the reservation, they can then come down to run a quick check to make sure that everything is working properly and to let you know how to turn everything on.

So, please let me know a few days before March 16 if you will be needing the room, and I will then ask IT to follow up if necessary.

Let me know if you need anything else!

INC0994177,"INFORMATION REQUEST - DANA, setting up lecture capture","*** Hello Donna, I was able to get more information on this.  In the Dana Building there are two rooms that have a lecture capture system, they are 1028 and 1040.  To setup a recording a request should be made to the IT group, in this case that would likely be LSA ISS, I know John Stewart (jhstew) has setup recordings for LSA in Dana in the past.  The lecture is scheduled using the CAEN leccap system, it automatically starts recording at the scheduled time running until it is scheduled to stop.  The recording captures audio, video, and the slides if a slide presentation is used.  The files are stored on CAEN servers, once the recording is complete it is edited and published.  At that time a web link will be provided that allows you to view the published recording.  I hope this information is helpful.  Thank you, -Dan ***","Donna called to inquire about the process for setting up a lecture capture session. 

Specific questions she mentioned are:
What is involved in setting up and scheduling a lecture capture? (for 2-3 classes). Video and/or audio?
What is she required to do to set up and operate a session?
Where are the files stored and how can she access them?

Would you reach out to her and lend a hand?
Thank-you!

I am glad we could meet today in 1000 SNB to review the lectern controls. I will be closing this ticket at this time. If you need to re-open this ticket you can do so by replying to this email. For any other computing needs please call 4-Help and submit a ticket.

Recap on turning everything on:
1. Wiggle mouse or click buttons on keyboard to wake the lectern computer up.
2. If after step one you do not see a control alt delete log in screen check that lectern computer and monitor are on.
3. To wake up the Crestron panel just click the black screen then click again on the ""press to begin"" screen.
4. Easiest way to set things up is to select preset 1 (This will replicate image on lectern monitor one on both projections screens. The second lectern monitor will be private and can be used to for things like presenter notes).

Tips: 
-After selecting preset 1 you can select audio visual on the Creston panel and at this screen you can mute audio and use video mute to black out projection screens.
-If you want to use presenter mode in a PowerPoint Presentation Select the Slide Show tab then check the box for presentation mode. You will not see your notes until you start the slide show.
-You can log in with generic nursing account if you ever want to log in for an instructor but prevent them from having access to your data.

When you turn off the system, after a cool-down period, the projectors retract.  There are two sets of buttons on the wall that will retract or extend the projectors without shutting them off though.  That appears to have been done in this case, since the crestron control panel was still turned on and the system was still powered up.  We powered it down and then started it up and turned it off again and everything seems to be working as it should.

Isslam,

Sorry for delayed reply.  I was working on a UMSI guest visit this week.

Thanks for sending the revised UMSN and UMSI faculty mixer/boaster agenda.  I put together the UMSI faculty email invite.  It'll go out shortly w/ agenda attached.

Dean Tom Finholt will be told that UMSN is likely to show slides for agenda item #4.

Not sure if our faculty will have slides for agenda item #5 or just talk about UMSI education, research and training.

If we bring slides, presumably any format (PDF, PowerPoint, Google slides, etc.) on a USB flash drive is fine.  If we bring a laptop, is the projector input VGA or HDMI in 1250 SNB?

Should we bring our own laptop dongle (adapter) if needed or does the room have dongles?

On our invite I listed the RSVP deadline: Thurs, April 6.  If you're ordering from Michigan Catering, they want a final count the week before.

If you don't need that much lead time for the RSVP, let me know.

Thanks, Todd

P.S. I looked at the message from your dean (LINK<http://www.nursing.umich.edu/about-our-school/message-dean>).  The video shows her middle initial as ""A."" however, the message's signature line shows her middle initial as ""D.""

Not a big deal, but your marketing people might want to know.?

Isslam,

Dean Finholt did say he was fine w/ UMSN's agenda (attached) for the faculty mixer w/ UMSI.

It's not how boaster sessions are typically structured.  However, our invite to UMSI faculty would still ask them to be prepared to talk about their research and UMSN's agenda would be attached.

If UMSN plans formal presentations (data slides), it would help to let Dean Finholt know.

If UMSN is changing the agenda, please let me know.

There's no rush, but sending the invite early March could be useful so that faculty have it on their calendar.

Thanks, Todd

Isslam,

I showed the attached agenda to Dean Finholt.  It's not typical for a boaster session, but he's fine w/ it.

We plan to modify the wording of our email invite to UMSI faculty.

With the UMSN agenda, it's not practical for faculty to each give a one minute boast about their research.  We'll attach your agenda so that our faculty see it.

Attached is the graphic banner we plan to use on the email invite.  You're welcome to use it if it helps.

Hi Arun, Anne, and Ember,
 
I hope your respective weekends were great, especially with the amazing weather we had!
 
This is just a friendly reminder that our media team will be filming the student debates tomorrow, and we need to finalize a few details:
 
1.  As discussed previously, our team will need to set up starting at 10:30 AM, and since room 2024 isn't available then because of another class, we'll have to record in a different room.  Can that new room location be shared with us sometime today?
 
2.  Can someone from SNRE IT meet briefly with our team in the new location around 10:30-45 AM to discuss the audio equipment in the room?
 
3.  Arun, attached to this message is a release form for your students to complete and submit to us at the start of class tomorrow.  It's very important that we receive these forms from any MOOC-participating student, so please emphasize this to them.  (At least one student, Alice, has previously filled out a release form, but she'll have to fill out this one, as it supersedes her earlier one.  She won't have to do another one after this.)
 
4.  If any students choose not to be part of the MOOC (thereby not completing the release form), we will make the necessary arrangements to exclude them from filming.  However, if you can please share your contingency plan with us regarding how to handle those specific students' debates, we'd appreciate it.  (In other words, how should we handle a debate that includes a student who has opted out of the MOOC?)
 
Most of this won't need to be repeated for future debate/presentation filming, aside from finding a classroom that can be accessed by our team an hour before class starts.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Many thanks for your help with all of this!
 
Thanks again,
James

INC0969913,Please check projectors in the Ehrlicher Room,"So, Jake and I checked out the Erlicher Room again this morning.  After working for about 5 minutes, we did hear what I would describe as a humming noise coming out of the ceiling speakers, which are near both projectors.  After fiddling with the volume controls on the touch panel for a while to no effect, we opened the AV closet and noticed that the volume controls on the Crown amp in the rack were turned up to full volume.  We reduced the volume on the amp to about 75%, adjusted the volume on the touch panel accordingly, and we both perceived that the humming had gone away.

I'll try to get some opinions for people at the event tomorrow to make sure we're not selectively blocking the noise out.  But I think it's fixed.  Thanks again everyone for bringing it to our attention.
