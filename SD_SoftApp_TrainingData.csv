INC0969572,Software request: Adobe Acrobat Pro,"Hi Anthony,

It was nice working with you this morning. It looks like the best option for your redaction needs is to use Adobe Acrobat XI Pro on the MiApps platform. After the PDF is created in Word, you can open it in Acrobat Pro and choose Tools>Protection>Mark for Redaction, then Apply Redactions and save the redacted file with a new name (it automatically adds ""-Redacted"" for you).

I am looking for software that allows me to send students redacted
information. There seems to be software available,  Adobe Acrobat Pro,
however there is an annual fee. Do we have any software here at UM that I
can use to redact files that can be sent over email?

Here is a site that explains my problem:

I moved the computer from 3040 to 3355 and set up the monitor. I also installed the software on the computer, I apologize if you received a bunch of emails for software installs. Some of the software had to be installed using a trial version because I don't have the licence for it, and I wanted you to be aware of when they expire. Rhino is one of the programs that was installed using the trial version we can discuss with Moe how to get the full version. I also didn't see arcgis so I pushed it and left the desktop in the log off state, if you don't see arcgis please let me know. Please feel free to let me know if you have further questions.

Unfortunately the Wrike app you were looking to install is google business accounts app that would have to be installed for the entire umich domain, which would mean it would be enabled for everyone with a umich google account and would pose significant licensing issues.
