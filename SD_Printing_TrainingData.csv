I thought about doing it myself, but might just cause trouble, so would
like to request for assistance this time.

I would also like to ask help with creating a qualtrics account for our

lastly, i want to ask for the best way to more accurately record

something that an upgraded account could do?

I checked with our print team and unfortunately there is no way to re-send the print job. We do not hold on to the actual files that are printed. In the future, I would recommend that you use the Follow Me print queue instead of printing directly to a printer if you are printing from home. That way when you get to the printer you would just swipe your Student ID/badge at the printer and then the document will print. You will find more information on setting up Follow Me printing in the link below.

Elizabeth,
Looks like we got the images printing more clearly.
Have a great day.

Jon Hall 
ITS N. Campus","Hello,

We have a printing quality issue on our color printer, Auxillary Services
Building 1 Rm C130 Color

The Printer:

m-auxs1-C130-color-1

It's an HP Color LaserJet Enterprise M750
The printer was brand new in Fall 2015.

?


The Issue:

There are continuous bands at the top edge of the paper, with mixed black
and colored inks. If we do a large print job that has white in that area,
it will eventually fade, just to come back again later.




??



We have replaced black and cyan print cartridges. We have also run several
cleaning pages and the laser cleaning function, which did not fix the issue.

We had two of your MiWorkspace staff here last Friday to look at an
unrelated issue, but took a sample of the printing with them.

Location:

We are located at the Stamps School of Art & Design Faculty and Grad
studios at 1919 Green Road. It is at the SW corner of the Plymouth and
Green Road park and ride/commuter lot (far back and left after entering).
The building is card access only, so we would need to let someone in (for
this afternoon call 616-403-5295).

Your help is much appreciated, thanks!

We probably installed your printer before the driver update from our Print Team. Once we reinstalled the printer is defaulted to black and white. We should be good to go. have a great day!

We just received a new Xerox printer and I had the it team come to help set
up the print settings because we would like the default to be B&W and it
seemed to work for a few days, but now my default seems to be color even if
I just printed black and white from a web page.

We also do not have any of the scan user settings that we did on the old
device. Does that mean we have to go in and add one by one all of our staff
again?

 Please let me know if you need anything else from my end.

It should be pretty slick, actually.  http://mprint.umich.edu/install via a browser should work for MWS and non-MWS devices alike, as long as the user is granted access to the appropriate printers as they would be if they were printing from a UM device.  The install site should be able to tell the difference between a MiWorkspace and non-MiWorkspace device,, and on a non-MWS device it should walk you through the steps for setting up the necessary things (the PaperCut Client) to get you up and running for printing to MWS devices.  The user will log in to PaperCut with their standard uniqname and password.

I'm happy I was able to stop by and provide a workaround to the printer error today. I've made some adjustments with the settings and determined that the cause of the issue appears to be stemming entirely from Tray 1. As such, I disabled it and put regular 8.5 * 11 paper in tray 2 and the enlongated 8.5 * 14 menu paper in the bypass tray. After many test prints, it seems like printing can occur without additional error. I placed a sticky note on the printer that states to please refrain from using tray 1 and only populate tray 2 and the bypass tray with paper. If the errors return, something is not right, or you have additional questions or concerns, feel free to respond back to this message and the ticket will re-open.

Sincerely,

The copier needed to be rebooted because it wasn't getting a valid network address.  Once we did that print jobs started coming through and we were able to get successful scan jobs sent.  I scanned what I thought was the scan job you were trying to send through; I did it twice the first job was at 300x300 dpi and the second was the default 200x200 dpi in case you needed more resolution.

I believe that this should fix the problem and you should be able to scan without issue now.  If you do find that you still have problems or need additional assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us.

It was good seeing you again and thank you for letting me assist with your printer issues.  As you mentioned in the ticket you could not print to either printer since the change from Konca to Xerox and also the HP printer was not functioning.  I rebooted both printers, and this fixed the HP, but not the Xerox.  I uninstalled both printers and that still did not work so I started and stopped the print spool  and again this did not work.

I spoke to the EUC print team and they showed me a way how to check the drives for any corruption - one Xerox driver was broken and this was the fix.  I tested both printers and pages came out.

Thank you for all you do for ITS and The University of Michigan!

I apologize that we weren't able to find a way to get the authentication code to permanently remain in the settings on the Mac computer today. Unfortunately, according to our print team, this is due to a glitch with the drivers and what the printer manufacturer is supporting at this time. The potential work-arounds to this issue are to have the department purchase a card reader in lieu of a code-based authentication track, remove the authentication track all together, or input the authentication code each time. Please let me know if you have additional questions about this, and I'll be happy to assist.
