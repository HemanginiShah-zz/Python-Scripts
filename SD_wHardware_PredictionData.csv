Laptop is having problems connecting to monitors via docking station, and may need some sort of hardware repair/replacement.

As noted in INC1049341:

""tried both VGA and DisplayPort cables, updated the dock firmware, updated the display driver, swapped the dock with a known good dock, and swapped the monitor with one we had in stock. With DisplayPort the monitor comes on for a few seconds then flickers off for a few then comes back on for a few. With VGA there's no display. I'm thinking at this point that it's something hardware-related with the connection between the computer and the dock.""

I've also attempted it on a different kind of dock we have in the office. It'll sometimes work, but will often lose connection, especially if you move the dock or do anything that could jiggle the computer/dock port connection. Sometimes it only connects to one monitor. I'm thinking there's a problem specific to the laptop port that may need to be replaced/repaired. 

MIWS tag is MIWS0014859. Serial Number 8CG53721P6.

Please let me know if you need anymore info!

Per our conversation today, my HP laptop with docking station, two
monitors, wireless keyboard and mouse, and speakers, will become available
on June 5 for your student's workstation. I'm sending you the computer
information in case you want to submit a help ticket to plan for getting it

Matt B.","Good afternoon,

Another of our faculty members, Dr. Dana Tschannen ( djvs ), would like to request a quote for some new computer equipment as well. Specifically, Dr. Tschannen needs a new laptop computer like the one that she currently uses in her office (room 4152 NIB).

The laptop will need to be able to connect to the Konica Printer in the fourth floor printing room (i.e., 4157), and it will need to function with MiWorkspace. Please note that this has been a recurring issue with Dr. Tschannen's current laptop, which is a Macintosh. (I have attached some documentation of this issue to this email.) The computer will also need to have enough memory to support using an application called Second Life, and it will need a good graphics card.

Dr. Tschannen is also curious to know how much it might cost for her to get one of the larger, rectangular monitors. Please note that this item may need to be purchased from a different account. If we can get an idea of how much these items might cost individually, we can then provide information as to how it should be purchased.

When responding to this email, please include Dr. Dana Tschannen (djvs@med.umich.edu<mailto:djvs@med.umich.edu>) and Alisa Maiville (maiville@umich.edu<mailto:maiville@umich.edu>) so that we will all receive the information at the same time.
